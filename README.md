# chainhammer v59
TPS measurements of parity aura, geth clique, quorum, tobalaba, etc. 
It should work with any Ethereum type chain; we focused on PoA consensus.

## instructions

## Docker-compose
Do `docker-compose up` to run.
Do `docker-compose up --scale chainhammer=2` to scale into 2 instances

### video
The brand new release v55 is now presented & explained in a useful [video on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTYnsfs5U7I).

### folders
* `hammer/` - submits many transactions, while watching the recent blocks
* `reader/` - reads blocks; visualizes TPS, blocktime, gas, bytes - see [reader/README.md](reader/README.md)
* `docs/` - see esp. reproduce.md, cloud.md, FAQ.md, **new:** azure.md
* `results/` - for each client one markdown file; `results/runs/` - auto-generated pages
* `logs/` - check this first if problems
* `networks/` - network starters & external repos via install script, see below
* `scripts/` - installers and other iseful bash scripts
* `env/` - Python virtualenv, created via install script, see below
* `tests/` - start whole integration test suite via `./pytest.sh`

### chronology
See the [results/](results/) folder:

1. [log.md](results/log.md): initial steps; also tried *Quorum's private transactions*
1. [quorum.md](results/quorum.md): raft consensus, quorum is a geth fork
1. [tobalaba.md](results/tobalaba.md): parity fork of  EnergyWebFoundation
1. [quorum-IBFT.md](results/quorum-IBFT.md): IstanbulBFT, 2nd consensus algo in quorum
1. [geth.md](results/geth.md): geth clique PoA algorithm
1. [parity.md](results/parity.md): parity aura PoA algorithm, many attempts to accelerate
1. [eos.md](results/eos.md): not begun yet
1. [substrate.md](results/substrate.md): not begun yet

## results summary

**Outdated table** in which I had run each of the experiments *manually* 
in autumn 2018; *soon* re-done completely, using the below automation. 
So please contact me *now*, if you know how to accelerate any of these clients:

[Reproduce](docs/reproduce.md) these results easily; for the `config` column also see there.
Quickest reproduction with my [Amazon AMI readymade image](docs/reproduce.md#readymade-amazon-ami).
And see that bottom of [parity.md](results/parity.md) and [geth.md](results/geth.md) 
and [quorum-IBFT.md](results/quorum-IBFT.md) for the latest runs, issues, and additional details.

## faster wider more
* how I initially got this faster, *on Quorum*, step by step, please do read the 1st logbook [log.md](results/log.md)
* then I improved per client, see each in [#chronology](#chronology) above
* (possible [TODOs](docs/TODO.md) - any other ideas?)

but not much more needed = the current version is already fully automated. Use it! May it help you to improve the speed of your Ethereum client!

### you
Add yourself to [other-projects.md](docs/other-projects.md) using chainhammer, or projects which are similar to this.   

(Especially if you work in one of the dev teams, you know your client code best - ) please try to improve the above results, e.g. by varying the CLI arguments with which the nodes are started; I don't see that as my job, you will be much more successful with that.

See parity [PE#9393](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/issues/9393), parity [SE#58521](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/58521/parity-tps-optimization-please-help), geth [GE#17447](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/17447), quorum [Q#479](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/issues/479#issuecomment-413603316).

*Please report back when you have done other / new measurements.*


## install and run
All this is developed and much tested on Debian, locally and in the AWS cloud. New: Ubuntu now also supported, see below.

### quickstart
N.B.: Better do this on a *disposable cloud, or virtualbox machine*; because the installation makes lasting changes and needs sudo!  

After unpacking a ZIP of the downloaded repo, or by
```
git clone https://github.com/drandreaskrueger/chainhammer drandreaskrueger_chainhammer
ln -s drandreaskrueger_chainhammer CH
cd CH
```

you now only need these **two lines** *to prepare and run the 1st experiment!*
```
scripts/install.sh
CH_TXS=1000 CH_THREADING="sequential" ./run.sh $HOSTNAME-TestRPC testrpc
```
You will then have a diagram, and a HTML and MD page about this run!

(on **Ubuntu** instead: `scripts/install.sh docker ubuntu` )

#### activate docker 

Better now *logout & login*, or *close the terminal, and open a new terminal*, because the above scripts/install.sh might have enabled docker for the the first time for this user. Then:

#### All supported clients in one go:

For the **full integration test**, run each client for a short moment:
```
export CH_MACHINE=yourChoice
./run-all_small.sh
```

For detailed instructions, please see [docs/](docs/), esp. [reproduce.md](docs/reproduce.md), and for troubleshooting [FAQ.md](docs/FAQ.md) and [github issues](https://github.com/drandreaskrueger/chainhammer/issues).

## benchmarking a remote node
Chainhammer can now be stripped down to its pure benchmarking abilities, i.e. without the installation of docker and without the three local network starters (parity-deploy, geth-dev, quorum-crux). It was successfully used to benchmark the Microsoft Azure blockchain-as-a-service product.  The essential difference is to start the installation with the switch `nodocker`:

    scripts/install.sh nodocker

So, if you just want to benchmark your *existing Ethereum node or network*, have a look at the manual [docs/azure.md](docs/azure.md) . 

## unittests
```
./pytest.sh
```
enables the virtualenv, 
then starts a `testrpc-py` Ethereum simulator on http://localhost:8545 in the background, 
logging into `tests/logs/`; 
then runs `./deploy.py andtests`; 
and finally runs all the unittests, also logging into `tests/logs/`.  

(Instead of testrpc-py) if you want to run tests with another node, 
just start that; and run `pytest` manually:
```
source env/bin/activate
py.test -v --cov
```

There were 98 tests on January 23rd, all 98 PASSED
(see this [logfile](tests/logs/tests-with_testrpc-py.log.ansi)  --> 
`cat tests/logs/*.ansi` because colors) on these different Ethereum providers:  

* testrpc instantseal (`testrpc-py`)  13 seconds 
* geth Clique (`geth-dev`) 63 seconds
* quorum IBFT (`blk-io/crux`) 59 seconds
* parity instantseal (`parity-deploy`) 8 seconds
* parity aura (`parity-deploy`) 72 seconds

# The following diagrams are outdated! Just make your own, new ones, with:
CH_MACHINE=yourChoice ./run-all_large.sh
```

## chainhammer: hammer --> reader -->  diagrams
examples:

### geth clique on AWS t2.xlarge 
[geth.md](results/geth.md) = geth (go ethereum client), "Clique" consensus.

50,000 transactions to an Amazon t2.xlarge machine.

Interesting artifact that after ~14k transactions, the speed drops considerably - but recovers again. [Reported](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/17447#issuecomment-431629285).

reader/img/geth-clique-50kTx_t2xlarge_tps-bt-bs-gas_blks12-98.png

### quorum IBFT on AWS t2.xlarge 

[quorum-IBFT.md](results/quorum-IBFT.md) = Quorum (geth fork), IBFT consensus, 20 millions gasLimit, 1 second istanbul.blockperiod; 20000 transactions multi-threaded with 23 workers. Initial average >400 TPS then drops to below 300 TPS, see [quorum issue](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/issues/479#issuecomment-413603316))

![quorum-crux-IBFT_t2xlarge_tps-bt-bs-gas_blks320-395.png](reader/img/quorum-crux-IBFT_t2xlarge_tps-bt-bs-gas_blks320-395.png)


### quorum raft
OLD RUN on a desktop machine.  

[quorum.md](results/quorum.md) = Quorum (geth fork), raft consensus, 1000 transactions multi-threaded with 23 workers, average TPS around 160 TPS, and 20 raft blocks per second)
![reader/img/quorum_tps-bt-bs-gas_blks242-357.png](reader/img/quorum_tps-bt-bs-gas_blks242-357.png)


### tobalaba
OLD RUN on a desktop machine.

[tobalaba.md](results/tobalaba.md) = Public "Tobalaba" chain of the EnergyWebFoundation (parity fork), PoA; 20k transactions; > 150 TPS if client is well-connected.

![reader/img/tobalaba_tps-bt-bs-gas_blks5173630-5173671.png](reader/img/tobalaba_tps-bt-bs-gas_blks5173630-5173671.png)

### parity aura v1.11.11 on AWS t2.xlarge 
[parity.md#run-18](results/parity.md#run-18) = 
using [parity-deploy.sh](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-deploy) 
dockerized network of 4 local nodes with increased gasLimit, and 5 seconds blocktime; 
20k transactions; ~ 60 TPS on an Amazon t2.xlarge machine.

N.B.: Could not work with parity v2 yet because of bugs 
[PD#76](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-deploy/issues/76) and 
[PE#9582](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/issues/9582) --> 
everything still on parity v1.11.11

![parity-v1.11.11-aura_t2xlarge_tps-bt-bs-gas_blks5-85.png](reader/img/parity-v1.11.11-aura_t2xlarge_tps-bt-bs-gas_blks5-85.png)  
parity-v1.11.11-aura_t2xlarge_tps-bt-bs-gas_blks5-85.png


**Calling all parity experts: How to improve these too slow TPS results?**
    
See issue [PE#9393](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/issues/9393), 
and the [detailed log of what I've tried already](results/parity.md), 
and the 2 shortest routes to reproducing the results: [reproduce.md](docs/reproduce.md).    

Thanks.
